<h1>OOMPA PROJECT</h1>
<h2>Thresher</h2>
The Thresher
<A HREF="https://r-forge.r-project.org/">R-Forge</A> project is one
component of the broader OOMPA Project produced by the
<A HREF = "https://gitlab.com/krcoombes/coombeslab">Coombes Lab</A>
over the past decade. it consists of a set of packages to help with
more advanced class discovery, clustering, and visualization.

<h3>Support</h3>
Support for all packages that are part of the OOMPA family uses a
common set of discussion forums and bug trackers:

<h3>List of Packages</h3>
<dl>
<dt><A HREF="http://thresher.r-forge.r-project.org/packages/PCDimension.html">PCDimension<A></dt>
<dd>The PCDiimension package, which was described in a paper by
  <A HREF="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29881252/">M Wang and
  colleagures</A>, implements and automates a graphical Bayesian
  method to determine the number of principal components that was introduced
  by <A HREF="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03610910701855005">Auer
  and Gervini</A> in 2008.  Wang's paper also introduces the idea of
  "biological components", which shoud be thought of as an
  intereptetable (if redundant) replacement for principal components.</dd>
<dt><A HREF="http://thresher.r-forge.r-project.org/packages/Thresher.html">Thresher<A></dt>
  <dd>The Thresher package uses the PCDimension package as a starting
  point to estimate the number of clusters present in a data set. The
  key idea is that the number <I>N</I> of clusters should lie between <I>N</I>
  and <I>2N+1</I> where <I>N</I> is the number of PC components. More
  details can be found in another paper
  by <A HREF="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29310570/">M Wang and
  colleagues</A>. The paper also points out that Thresher can remove
  outliers at the same time as it determines clusters.</dd>
<dt><A HREF="http://thresher.r-forge.r-project.org/packages/Mercator.html">Mercator<A></dt>
  <dd>The Mercator package was introduced in a paper
  by <A HREF="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33515233/">Abrams
  and colleagues</A>. The package has multiple goals. First, it
  impements a variety of binary distance metrics, Second, it provides
  consistent interfaces to a variety of clustering and visualization
  methods, with an emphasis on being able to color samples
  consistently across different methods.</dd>
<dt><A HREF="http://thresher.r-forge.r-project.org/packages/RCytoGPS.html">RCytoGPS<A></dt>
<dd>In Zach Abrams' PhD thesis, he developed an algorithm called
  Cytogenetics Pattern Sleuth (CytoGPS) that can parse karyotypes
  written in a standard text form known as
  the <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_for_Human_Cytogenetic_Nomenclature">International
  System for Human Cytogenetic Nomenclature</A> and convert them into
  binary vectors accessible to modern machine learning methods.  That
  algorithm is available online
  at <A HREF="http://cytogps.org/">http://cytogps.org/</A>. The
  RCytoGPS package (see the pair of papers by Abrams and colleagues
  in <A HREF="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34601554/">BMC
  Bioinfomratics</A>
  and <A HREF="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33648439/">Bioinformatics</A>)
  provides tools to import the output of the web site into R so it
  can be analyzed and visualized.</dd>
<dt><A HREF="http://thresher.r-forge.r-project.org/packages/SillyPutty.html">SillyPutty<A></dt>
  <dd>The SillyPutty package introduces a novel clustering
  algorithm, based on optimizing silhouette widths. A manuscript
  describing and evaluating the algorithm is in preparation; the
  package will be submitted to CRAN when the manuscript is completed.</dd>
