		CHANGES IN R VERSION 1.0.2

BUG FIXES

    o	Simulation code works differently on different machines, even
        when setting the same seed. The issue can be traced through
        reliance on 'mvrnorm"' and 'eigen' to simulate multivariate
        normal data. When there are repeated eigenvalues, different
        linear alg=ebra routines can (legitimetaly) choose different
        orthogonal bases for the correrspsoninf multidimensional
        eigenspace. Have tried to refactor the test code so that this
        doesn't matter.

MAINTENANCE

    o	Updated use of S4 class defintions to avod newly deprecated methods.
