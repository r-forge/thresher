Title: Finding the Number of Significant Principal Components
Authors@R: c(person(given = "Min", family = "Wang", role = "aut"),
	    person(given = c("Kevin", "R."), family = "Coombes",
                   role = c("aut", "cre"), email = "krc@silicovore.com"))
Description: Implements methods to automate the Auer-Gervini graphical
  Bayesian approach for determining the number of significant
  principal components. Automation uses clustering, change points, or
  simple statistical models to distinguish "long" from "short" steps
  in a graph showing the posterior number of components as a function
  of a prior parameter. See <doi:10.1101/237883>.
