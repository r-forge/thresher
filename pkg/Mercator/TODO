# Prioritized to-do list

* Make another Mercator constructor, this time for continuous
  data. All distance matrices from 'dist' or 'distanceMatrix'
  should be usable.
* Decide if we want to add any more binary distance measures from the
  Choi paper.
* Check the example RMD scripts in inst/Examples for correctness.
* Should there be a function to compute the relative frequencies?
  (See pipeline report 305.)
* Should the code to make the DT or ztable stuff be part of the
  package? What about the part trying to interpret features and
  samples, especially the final heatmap?
* Should the SOM plots be part of the package? note that these
  depend on the actual data matrix, not just the distance matrix.
