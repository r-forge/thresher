# Prioritized to-do list

* When the dust setttles on R-4.1, see if we can remove the non-real
  dependency on the "Imports: flexmix" line in DESCRIPTION.
* Decide if we want to add any more binary distance measures from the
  Choi paper.
* Should there be a function to compute the relative frequencies?
  (See pipeline report 305.)
* Should the code to make the DT or ztable stuff be part of the
  package? What about the part trying to interpret features and
  samples, especially the final heatmap?
* Should the SOM plots be part of the package? note that these
  depend on the actual data matrix, not just the distance matrix.
