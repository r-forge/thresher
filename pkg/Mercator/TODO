1. Decide if we want to add any more binary distance measures from the
   Choi paper.

2. Fix bug in igraph with assuming mds view exists.
   (NOT SURE WHAT THIS MEANS)

3. Fix bug in heatmap where heat does not produce a heatmap. HACKED:
   Removed this from the documentation. Mainly because I'm no longer sure
   what the default behavior of a heatmap should be for a distance matrix

4. Check the example RMD scripts in inst/Examples for correctness.

5. Add a "plot" method for Mercator objects that would look like
   plot(myObject, view = c("tsne", "mds"))
   What should we use as the default 'view'?

6. Implement the option to add new visualization instead of
   overwriting.

7. Should the Mercator constructor take a list of visualizations to
   create at start-up for an object?

8. Should there be a function to compute the relative frequencies?
    (See pipeline report 305.)

9. Should the code to make the DT or ztable stuff be part of the
    package? What about the part trying to interpret features and
    samples, especially the final heatmap?

10. Should the smoothed scatter plots be part of the package?

11. Should the SOM plots be part of the package? note that these
    depend on the actual data matrix, not just the distance matrixc.

12. Make another Mercator constructor, this time for continuous
    data. All distance matrices from 'dist' or 'sdidtanceMatrix'
    should be usable.
