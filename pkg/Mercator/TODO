# Prioritized to-do list

* Make another Mercator constructor, this time for continuous
  data. All distance matrices from 'dist' or 'sdidtanceMatrix'
  should be usable.
* Implement an option to add new visualization instead of
  overwriting?
* Should the Mercator constructor take a list of visualizations to
  create at start-up for an object?
* Should the smoothed scatter plots be part of the package?
* Decide if we want to add any more binary distance measures from the
  Choi paper.
* Fix bug in heatmap where heat does not produce a heatmap. HACKED:
  Removed this from the documentation. Mainly because I'm no longer sure
  what the default behavior of a heatmap should be for a distance matrix
* Check the example RMD scripts in inst/Examples for correctness.
* Should there be a function to compute the relative frequencies?
  (See pipeline report 305.)
* Should the code to make the DT or ztable stuff be part of the
  package? What about the part trying to interpret features and
  samples, especially the final heatmap?
* Should the SOM plots be part of the package? note that these
  depend on the actual data matrix, not just the distance matrix.
