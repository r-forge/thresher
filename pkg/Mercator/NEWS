		CHANGES IN R VERSION 0.10.1

BUG FIX

    o	Fixed the bug with missing names on `clusters` slot. Again.

		CHANGES IN R VERSION 0.10.0

NEW FEATURES

    o	Can now use `slot(object, "palette") <- ...1 to change the
        palette associated with a Mercator object.

BREAKING CHANGES

    o	Mercator objects no longer have `colvv` or `symv` slots. To
`    retain the old functionality, you must instead use the new
     internal functions with same names; for example, write
     `Mercator:::colv(object)` instead  of `object@colv`.

		CHANGES IN R VERSION 0.9.6

BUG FIXES

    o	Fixed a bug in "addVisualization" to make sure all matrices
    	have non-NULL rownames.

    o	Fixed a NAMESPACE/import bug. The 'scatter' method calls the
    	'smoothScatter' function from 'graphics'. This in turn calls a
    	hidden (unexported) function from 'grDevices' using three
    	colons (:::), which calls 'KernSmooth::bkde2D' without
    	importing anything. CRAN checks force my package to know this
    	internal implementation anhd import the function explicitly.

		CHANGES IN R VERSION 0.9.5

BUG FIXES

    o	Fixed an igraph "jitter" bug in a test script.

		CHANGES IN R VERSION 0.9.4

NEW FEATURES

    o	Added a new "barplot" method for the Mercator class, which
        plots the silhouette widths in the colors already assigned to
        clusters.

    o	Added a new "scatter" method for the Mercator class, which
        displays some views as a smoothed scatter plot.

		CHANGES IN R VERSION 0.9.2

NEW FEATURES

    o	Added a new "plot" method for the Mercator class, which
        automatically sets the colors and symbols for different
        views.

		CHANGES IN R VERSION 0.9.1

BUG FIXES

    o	Fixed the bug in overcounting "redundant" or "unused" features.

		CHANGES IN R VERSION 0.9.0

BREAKING CHANGES

    o	Deprecated the "recolor" function in favor of a new name, "setClusters".

		CHANGES IN R VERSION 0.8.8

BUG FIXES

    o	Checked all the documentation; first version submitted to CRAN.

		CHANGES IN R VERSION 0.8.7

BUG FIXES

    o	Fixed the "names" bug in using iGraph visualizations.

		CHANGES IN R VERSION 0.8.2

FEATURES

    o	Added a (mostly) working vignette. (Is that a feature?)

		CHANGES IN R VERSION 0.8.0

BREAKING CHANGES

    o	Renamed the "recoverCluster" function to "getClusters".

		CHANGES IN R VERSION 0.7.8

BUG FIXES

    o	Fixed a NAMESPACE/DESCRIPTION issue to make it easier to work
        with slots borrowed from other classes.

		CHANGES IN R VERSION 0.7.7

BUG FIXES

    o	Worked around an issue in igraph, which doesn't like layouts
        where nodes overlap.

		CHANGES IN R VERSION 0.7.5

BUG FIXES

    o	Fixed a bug in igraph views, in order to work with more than
        48 clusters.

		CHANGES IN R VERSION 0.7.4

FEATURES

    o	Added a bunch of man pages (is that a feature?).

		CHANGES IN R VERSION 0.7.2

BUG FIXES

    o	Fixed a bug in "downsample", where probabilities could be
        greater than one.

		CHANGES IN R VERSION 0.7.1

BUG FIXES

    o	Fixed a labeling bug in "recolor".

    o	Updated data objects to use "Mercator" rather than
        "BinaryMatrix". 

		CHANGES IN R VERSION 0.7.0

BREAKING CHANGES

    o	Renamed the "DistanceVis" class to "Mercator".

    o	Renamed the whole package fromk "BinaryMatrix" to "Mercator"

BUG FIXES

    o	Fixed a "drop=FALSE" bug with subsetting "info" components
        when they are single-column data frames.

		CHANGES IN R VERSION 0.6.2

NEW FEATURES

    o	Added a "recoverCluster" function to the "DistanceVis"
        class. May eventually be converted to a "predict" method.

BUG FIXES

    o	Fixed a "drop=FALSE" bug with subsetting "info" components
        when they are single-column data frames.

		CHANGES IN R VERSION 0.6.0

NEW FEATURES

    o	Added new automatically computed graph layouts based on MDS
        and t-SNE.

		CHANGES IN R VERSION 0.5.0

NEW FEATURES

    o	Added a new visualization, based on igraph.

		CHANGES IN R VERSION 0.4.0

INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES

    o	Decided that the "recolor" function should be called
        "remapColors", since the point is to make color assiognments
        for two different distance metrics compatible

NEW FEATURES

    o	Added a **new** function called "recolor", which allows you
        to change the stored color assignments based on a new
        clustering using the same distance metric.

		CHANGES IN R VERSION 0.3.0

INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES

    o	Decided that the BinaryMatrix class needs to carry along
        information about both rows and columns, and not just
        columns. As a results, changed the name of te "featresa" slot
        to "columnInfo, and added a parallel "rowInfo" slot.

NEW FEATURES

    o	Added a transpose ("t") operator for a BinaryMatrix. 

		CHANGES IN R VERSION 0.2.0

NEW FEATURES

    o	Removed the (temporary) "CML.rda" file and replaced it with two
        smaller subsets, "CML1000.rda" and "CML500.rda". Restructured
        the appropriate test scripts to use the smaller data sets so
        they run faster.  Note that both subsets were created using
        the "downsample" function.

		CHANGES IN R VERSION 0.1.1

NEW FEATURES

    o	Added a "[" method to the DistanceVis class. Note the slowest
        part of this method presently is subsetting the hierarchical
        clusters, since it is implemented using the "prune" routine in
        "dendextend", which removes one leaf at a time.

    o	Added a "recolor" function thast allows you to make the
        color-and-symbol assigments for different distance matrices
        behave "as consistenbtly as possible".

    o	Added a "downsample" function based on Peng Qiu's idea in the
        SPADE package. The point is to take a subsample that
        deliberately does *not* preserve the popultion distribution.
        Instead, it samples fewer items fromt he most dense areas ofg
        the distribution in order to preserve samples of as many
        clusters as possible.

BUG FIXES

    o	Fixed a bug in the definiton of the Goodman-Kruskal
        similarity measure, where half a term (inside a "max"
        computation) had been accidentally omitted.

		CHANGES IN R VERSION 0.1.0

NEW FEATURES

    o	Initial version. Classes BVinaryMatrix and DistanceVis,
    	although the first may be misleading and the second is a lousy
    	name. Both may change by version 1.0.

BUG FIXES

    o	Numerous.
