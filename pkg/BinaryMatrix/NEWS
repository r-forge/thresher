		CHANGES IN R VERSION 0.3.0

INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES

    o	Decided that the BinaryMatrix class needs to carry along
        information about both rows and columns, and not just
        columns. As a results, changed the name of te "featresa" slot
        to "columnInfo, and added a parallel "rowInfo" slot.

NEW FEATURES

    o	Added a transpose ("t") operator for a BinaryMatrix. 

		CHANGES IN R VERSION 0.2.0

NEW FEATURES

    o	Removed the (temporary) "CML.rda" file and replaced it with two
        smaller subsets, "CML1000.rda" and "CML500.rda". Restructured
        the appropriate test scripts to use the smaller data sets so
        they run faster.  Note that both subsets were created using
        the "downsample" function.

		CHANGES IN R VERSION 0.1.1

NEW FEATURES

    o	Added a "[" method to the DistanceVis class. Note the slowest
        part of this method presently is subsetting the hierarchical
        clusters, since it is implemented using the "prune" routine in
        "dendextend", which removes one leaf at a time.

    o	Added a "recolor" function thast allows you to make the
        color-and-symbol assigments for different distance matrices
        behave "as consistenbtly as possible".

    o	Added a "downsample" function based on Peng Qiu's idea in the
        SPADE package. The point is to take a subsample that
        deliberately does *not* preserve the popultion distribution.
        Instead, it samples fewer items fromt he most dense areas ofg
        the distribution in order to preserve samples of as many
        clusters as possible.

BUG FIXES

    o	Fixed a bug in the definiton of the Goodman-Kruskal
        similarity measure, where half a term (inside a "max"
        computation) had been accidentally omitted.

		CHANGES IN R VERSION 0.1.0

NEW FEATURES

    o	Initial version. Classes BVinaryMatrix and DistanceVis,
    	although the first may be misleading and the second is a lousy
    	name. Both may change by version 1.0.

BUG FIXES

    o	Numerous.
