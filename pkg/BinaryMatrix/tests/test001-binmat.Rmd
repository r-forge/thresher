We assume that the input for all tests in the BinaryMatrix package should be in the form of the BinaryMatrix class.  
The BinaryMatrix class builds a list containing at least 2 basic components:  
1. A binary matrix of 0s and 1s.  
2. A features set, in the form of a dataframe.  

## Acceptable Matrix Input
First, we must determine what class of matrix input the BinaryMatrix object accepts.  
We assume our data are well-behaved in that they only consist of 0s and 1s.  
We begin by creating a small, simple matrix (20x20) of randomly generated binary values (0 or 1, p = 0.5) in each class.  
We create a meaningless feature set of class data.frame, which we will test further later.  

```{r prep}
library(BinaryMatrix)

set.seed(1987)
```
```{r}
f20 <- data.frame(as.character(c(1:20)))

t_int <- matrix(as.integer(rbinom(400, 1, 0.5)), nrow = 20, ncol = 20)
bm_int <- BinaryMatrix(t_int, f20)
summary(bm_int)

t_num <- matrix(as.numeric(rbinom(400, 1, 0.5)), nrow = 20, ncol = 20)
bm_num <- BinaryMatrix(t_num, f20)
summary(bm_num)

t_char <- matrix(as.character(rbinom(400, 1, 0.5)), nrow = 20, ncol = 20)
bm_char <- BinaryMatrix(t_char, f20)
summary(bm_char)

t_log <- matrix(as.logical(rbinom(400, 1, 0.5)), nrow = 20, ncol = 20)
bm_log <- BinaryMatrix(t_log, f20)
summary(bm_log)

myfac <- factor(rbinom(400, 1, 0.5), levels = c("0","1"), labels = c("Zero", "One"))
t_fac <- matrix(myfac, nrow = 200, ncol = 200, byrow = TRUE)
try(bm_fac <- BinaryMatrix(t_fac, f20))
try(summary(bm_fac))
```

The BinaryMatrix object will build with matrix input of 0s and 1s in integer, numeric, or character form, or as a matrix of logicals (true/false). The object fails to build with a factor.

## Acceptable Object
Clearly, the BinaryMatrix object accepts input in the form of a matrix. Does it accept other object structures?

```{r}
t_df <- data.frame(matrix(as.numeric(rbinom(400, 1, 0.5)), nrow = 20, ncol = 20))
try(bm_df <- BinaryMatrix(t_df, f20))
try(summary(bm_df))
```
Only the matrix class is accepted.
data frame, factor, vector 400

t_fac <- matrix(as.integer(rbinom(400, 1, 0.5)), nrow = 20, ncol = 20)
bm_int <- BinaryMatrix(t_int, f20)
summary(bm_int)
```
