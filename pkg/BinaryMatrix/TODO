1. Decide if we want to add any more binary distance measures from the
Choi paper.

2. Add something like the following to creatger additional layouts for
the graph visualization:

 V <- igraph::vertex_attr(G$graph)
 Y <- vis1@view[["tsne"]]$Y
 rownames(Y) <- labels(vis1@distance)
 layt <- Y[V$name,]
 plot(G$graph, layout=layt)
 M <- vis1@view[["mds"]]
 plot(G$graph, layout=M[V$name,])

3. Fix the "squares and circles" part of the igraph visualization to
handle the (admittedly extreme) cases when we have more symbols. (May
only be do-able using some really fancy tricks.)
